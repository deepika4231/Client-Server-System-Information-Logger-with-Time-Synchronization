# Client-Server-System-Information-Logger-with-Time-Synchronization
A Java-based client-server app that collects system info (OS, IP, RAM, disk space) from client machines and sends it to a server, which logs the data. The server also syncs the client's system date and time to match its own for consistent time management.
